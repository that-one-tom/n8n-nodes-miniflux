# n8n-nodes-miniflux

An [n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) node for [Miniflux v2](https://github.com/miniflux/v2). 

n8n is a workflow automation platform, making sure you'll never have to do all these tedious and boring manual tasks again. Miniflux is the only RSS reader you'll ever need. This node brings both tools together.

So far the node can fetch your feeds, feed entries and mark them as read. Going forward I plan to implement additional functionality from the [Miniflux API](https://miniflux.app/docs/api.html) and possibly add bonus features such as converting HTML content into plain text on the fly as part of the [n8n node-athon](https://n8n.io/n8n-node-athon/).
